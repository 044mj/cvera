`cvera` is an R package with a collection of utility R functions, useful in exploring Irish bTB datasets collated in CVERA.

---

## Installation

You can install the development version of cvera from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("044mj/cvera")
```

## Example

Extract yearly summary data and visualisations of reactor numbers from `master_tb` dataset. 

Read in data:

```{r reading_in, include = T, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# if using readr::read_csv() they use first 1000 rows to guess type. 
# If the first 1,000 are missing, it will default to logical. GIF variables are missing in the first 1000
#because it only came in during May 2019 so include col_types for these variables:
master_tb <- read_csv("N:/data/tb/master_tb_data_jamie_m/year_2022/master_tb_24_Mar_2022.csv", 
                          col_types = cols(.default = "?", 
                                           gif8d_actual_date = col_date(), 
                                           gif_cases = col_number()))
```

Using `all_cases_per_year` from `cvera` package:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(cvera)
#drop 2022 figures as we only have 3 months worth of data
cases <- all_cases_per_year(master_tb, drop_years = c(2022))
```


results in

```{r example_ouput, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
cases_example <- readRDS("data/cases_example.rds")
cases_example
```


## Interactive herd plot:


```{r herd_plot_out, eval = F, echo = T}
p <- herd_plot(master_tb, "x1234567") #fake herd
p
```

```{r herdplotfigure, echo = F, eval = T, include=T, warning = F, error=F, out.width="100%", out.width="100%", fig.cap = "Herd plot"}
knitr::include_graphics("data/herd_plot_figure.png") #works in chunk but not when you render
#knitr::include_graphics(path.expand("~/data/historic_gif_eamonn.png"))
```
