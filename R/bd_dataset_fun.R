#' @title bd_dataset_fun
#' @description \code{top} Creates BD file containing information on each BD.
#' @param df Master bTB dataset (master_tb).
#' @return returns BD dataset which only contains information on individual
#' BDs. If a herd never had a BD, they will not be in this file. Each row is
#' a summary of the BD (e.g. number of reactors over the BD period etc.). A
#' herd can have multiple rows if it has had more than one BD.
